# Machine-Predictive-Maintenance-Classification
This application is designed to predict machine failure for predictive maintenance using machine learning. It utilizes a synthetic dataset with 10,000 data points and 14 features. The application is built using a Random Forest model to classify whether the machine will experience failure or not based on the provided inputs.
